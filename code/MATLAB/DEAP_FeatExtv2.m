% This script uses the the DEAP data set to create a emotion classifier.
% this data set consists of experiments where various music videos were
% shown to users to evoke a particular emotion and EEG along with other
% biological signals were recorded. An SVM classifier is suggested for use
% in this.

%%
% v2 uses spectrogram vs bandpower to get spectral information. The
% difference is that bandpower returns a scalar value while spectrogram
% returns a qualitative number. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%                              UPDATE LOG
% 4/7/2015 CURRENT STATE
%   Currently this script will read in two csv files (data and lables) and
%   extrace time windowed features from the signal. The goal of this script
%   is to find what features will be most valuable to extract for the
%   model. Features implemetned are from IEEE paper from singapor
%   university
% TO DO:   

% USING EXTERNAL SCRIPT FOR THIS NOW
% ---run through all participants and caluculate the average corrolation
% for each feature. Then plot in colormap to see the result. Also find the
% average mean and std for each feature to plot in an error 
%
% ----Implement Combination features (spectral features specifically)
% & possibly fractal features if you can figure out how to do it in a way
% that is transferable easily to python.
